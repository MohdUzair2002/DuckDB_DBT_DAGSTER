🚀 Modern Data Pipeline with DuckDB, dbt, and Dagster
Overview
This repository showcases a modern data pipeline built using DuckDB, dbt, and Dagster, designed for efficient data transformation, orchestration, and analytics. The project demonstrates how to create a lightweight yet powerful ETL workflow that can handle large-scale data processing with high performance and minimal infrastructure overhead.

🛠️ Tech Stack
DuckDB – A high-performance, in-process OLAP database optimized for analytical workloads.
dbt (Data Build Tool) – A SQL-based transformation framework that enables modular, version-controlled data models.
Dagster – A modern data orchestrator that ensures data lineage, observability, and reliability in pipeline execution.
📌 Features
✅ Efficient Data Processing – Leveraging DuckDB’s columnar storage and vectorized execution for fast analytics.
✅ Modular & Scalable Transformations – Using dbt to define, test, and document SQL-based transformations.
✅ Orchestrated & Observable Pipelines – Dagster ensures seamless scheduling, dependency tracking, and monitoring.
✅ Cloud & Local Compatibility – Can be deployed locally or integrated with cloud storage solutions like S3, GCS, or Azure Blob Storage.
✅ Automated Testing & Version Control – Implementing dbt’s testing framework for reliable transformations.

💡 Use Cases
🔹 Analytical Workloads – Perform fast aggregations and queries on structured datasets.
🔹 ETL & Data Warehousing – Transform raw data into meaningful business insights.
🔹 Machine Learning Pipelines – Preprocess and orchestrate data for AI/ML applications.
